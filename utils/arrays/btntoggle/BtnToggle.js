        para : "In the seventh grade, the variety of lessons is much more than in the elementary school. The textbooks of this grade form the foundation of the higher years. Therefore, one should be careful in choosing the appropriate teaching method. This basic education is not hard, but it is new. Because students are not familiar with the subjects of this level, they may find it difficult and complicated. With the right teaching method, students gradually get to know the seventh grade and connect with its various lessons. The sooner this familiarization and communication happens, the easier students will learn lessons and perform better.In the seventh grade teaching method of Filimo School, the goal of our teachers is to establish communication between students and the new scientific world that they face at this point. Drama teaching method, working group, problem solving, storytelling, speech, group discussion and even teaching team members are among the effective methods in communicating students with this section. In school film videos, with attractive videos, problem solving teaching methods, storytelling, etc., all topics of the book are taught in full. The visual appeal of these educational videos helps to connect students with different lessons.",

In all these videos, all subjects are taught in full, without leaving out the smallest details, by experienced teachers. Also, while watching the videos, students see descriptive questions that they have to answer. These questions are for a better understanding of course concepts. At the end of the videos, we have prepared sample questions to measure the students' learning.The good thing about such educational videos is the possibility of watching them again and again. That is, if the student realizes that he has not learned a topic after solving the questions, he can look at the training again to solve his problem. Ninety seconds of all 7th grade instructional videos are available for free viewing on the school's Filmo. By watching these videos, you will get to know the school filmo teaching method and get to know our experienced teachers.In addition to these educational films, we have also considered extracurricular educational films for seventh grade students. Movies prepared for the leisure time of seventh grade students. With these movies, besides being entertained, students can learn a lot.

The more conceptually the lessons are taught at this level, the better students relate to them and in the following years, they will learn new lessons more easily.Seventh grade teenagers are still teenagers! So they have a sensitive spirit and are still struggling with puberty. When teaching and choosing the right teaching method, we must pay attention to this point. Students of this age love to participate in teaching. Commenting and talking about different topics is one of their favorite things. Therefore, it is better to choose a teaching method that also pays attention to these points.Students may experience an academic drop at the beginning of seventh grade due to new lessons. In this situation, you should not put pressure on them and increase their stress. Be sure that the student himself is sad for his academic failure and would like to make up for it. It is better to prepare a calm and pressure-free environment so that he can study with more concentration and feeling relaxed and make up for his setbacks. Pressure and stress only make things worse.:",
